2048 game by c#
1. There is a 4*4 grid which can be filled with any number. 
2. we have to press any one of four keys to move up, down, left, or right.
3. After this grid compression any random empty cell gets itself filled with 2.
4. Following the above process we have to double the elements by adding up and make 2048 in any of the cell. If we are able to do that we wins.
5. But if during the game there is no empty cell left to be filled with a new 2, then the game goes over.
